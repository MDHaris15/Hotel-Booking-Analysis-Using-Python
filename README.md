# Hotel Booking Analysis

In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have faced significant increases in their cancellation rates. These challenges have led to reduced revenue and underutilized rooms. The primary goal of this analysis is to reduce cancellation rates to enhance revenue generation and operational efficiency. This report focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations and other factors that impact business and annual revenue generation.

## Research Questions

- What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
- How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
- How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypotheses

- More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
- Longer waiting lists lead to more frequent cancellations.
- A majority of clients book through offline travel agents.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Analyses

- **Data Cleaning**
- **Customer Segmentation**
- **Seasonality Trends**
- **Cancellation Analysis**
- **Revenue Insights**
- **Visualization**

## Suggestions

- **Pricing Strategy:** Increasing prices are associated with higher cancellation rates. To mitigate this, hotels could refine their pricing strategies by offering reduced rates for specific locations and providing discounts to customers.
- **Cancellation Ratio:** The resort hotel experiences a higher ratio of cancellations compared to city hotels. Hotels should consider offering competitive room price discounts on weekends and holidays.
- **Marketing Campaigns:** During January, when cancellations peak, hotels can launch marketing campaigns with attractive offers to boost revenue.
- **Service Quality Enhancement:** Improving the quality of hotels and services, particularly in Portugal, can be an effective approach.
